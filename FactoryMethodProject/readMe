This project contains code that implements the Factory Method Design Pattern.

There are two type of laptops, both of which implement the Laptop interface: MacLaptop & WindowsLaptop.

The LaptopFactory is an interface that defines a method to build a laptop.
The type of Laptop that is built and returned is determined by the concrete factories that extend this interface. 

The Client takes a LaptopFactory as a parameter (dependency injection). It uses the factory to build a laptop and then uses it.

The Driver class acts as a main method that provides the Client with the appropriate factory based on some logic.
